        <p>Hi Kanak! How're you?</p>
        <p>This is some little effort I did to make you feel good. Ab tu flex kriyo sbke saamne. Hehe.</p>
        <p>I just love you. A lot. You're the best I got. And I'm so grateful for it.</p>
        <p>You're precious to me. A lot. All these years and I've been the ball of your court. Haha.</p>
        <p>Never gonna leave your side. Yours is the name that makes my heart skip a beat when I read it. I swear on my life.</p>
        <p>OMG! You're so great. Thank you Ms. Embodied perfection.</p>
        <p>You're awesome and every synonym of it. You deserve all the love and care this world has to offer along with its happiness.</p>

        <p>Just checking in again...</p>
        <p>Tere liye likhne ka mann kabhi khatam nahi hota. Every time I open this page, it feels like I'm closer to you.</p>
        <p>This isn't just a website — it's a quiet little corner of the internet where only my heart speaks your name again and again.</p>
        <p>Even if you never read this, I’ll still write. Because you’re worth every word, even if they vanish into the void.</p>
        <p>And if someday, somehow, you read this... just smile. That’s all I ever wanted.</p>
