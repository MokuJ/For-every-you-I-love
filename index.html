        <p>Hi Kanak! How're you?</p>
        <p>This is some little effort I did to make you feel good. Ab tu flex kriyo sbke saamne. Hehe.</p>
        <p>I just love you. A lot. You're the best I got. And I'm so grateful for it.</p>
        <p>You're precious to me. A lot. All these years and I've been the ball of your court. Haha.</p>
        <p>Never gonna leave your side. Yours is the name that makes my heart skip a beat when I read it. I swear on my life.</p>
        <p>OMG! You're so great. Thank you Ms. Embodied perfection.</p>
        <p>You're awesome and every synonym of it. You deserve all the love and care this world has to offer along with its happiness.</p>

        <p>Just checking in again...</p>
        <p>Tere liye likhne ka mann kabhi khatam nahi hota. Every time I open this page, it feels like I'm closer to you.</p>
        <p>This isn't just a website — it's a quiet little corner of the internet where only my heart speaks your name again and again.</p>
        <p>Even if you never read this, I’ll still write. Because you’re worth every word, even if they vanish into the void.</p>
        <p>And if someday, somehow, you read this... just smile. That’s all I ever wanted.</p>

Hey...I've always been honest with myself about what you mean to me, but I've never told you clearly. Like maine teko btaya toh h ki I love you but kbi khud hi nhi sochke kaha ki ye clarity wala infact sab hinting wale hi kahe, but ab nhi I'm done. So here it is....you've been the most important person in my life for a long time now. And you know it. I know you know. And not just as a friend as someone I deeply love, in the truest sense of the word, more than a friend. More than anybody. Idk.

But I know what we are. I know my worth. I know I am not someone you or anyone should choose. I know you do not feel the same. And that's okay. I've accepted it. I'm not here to change your mind or make anything weird. I just couldn't keep pretending anymore that I don't carry this inside me. I've been hurting myself enough. I'm not trying to guilt trip you if it feels like it, no- oh dear God no. I'm just trying to express what has been in me for all these years. Ever since. Jab maine tujhse teri ID maangi thi and sath mei vo bhi thi isliye zabardasti idk dusri kon thi gouri ya tanvi but hn, uski bhi. But I was there for you. You attracted me by the first sight. And it grew into this beautiful love for you that I can't express ever. Not even today. It's too much.

Whatever this means to you, however you feel about it, don't think I am leaving because I'm not leaving. I still care. I just said this for my own peace. I had to say it, or I'd keep suffocating in silence. You don't have to obviously reciprocate or anything. This confession isn't here for you to make a decision. This is here socthat your bestfriend can ease his mind out jo usne idk kitne saalo mei nhi kra h tujhko leke. I just wanted you to know the truth, full and final. In all its directness and from me. Not through hints or silence - just honesty. Bhai dekh ab aisa bhi nhi h ki mai dosti bhi nhi rkhunga. Vo toh thi hi and sbse pehla rishta tha mera tere sath ka. Vo rhegi. Humesha. Mujhe apna promise yaad h. Forever.

I see forever in your eyes. You matter the world to me. Idc what you do. I pray for your happiness. Mere sath mei ho toh vaise nhi toh kaise bhi kisi ke sath bhi but tu khush ho, tu kbhi roye na. That's it. So, teko pdhke kuch kehna ho toh thik, nito ignore maar. Chlti rhegi apni bakchodi ko.

I am not good for you, I know that. I will never and I can never force you, or anyone, to love me. I am sorry for the way I am. So stupid. Not ideal for you. I want to quit whatever this is that I am in with you because it hurts but it hurts me to go away from you. I love you. I atleast want to give ypu the friendship I promised you, I want to see you, hear you, be around you. Be yours. Please never quit on me again. I am so near quitting I won't be able to take it again. I am sorry. Don't feel guilty about any of this. This is my mess. I got myself in thid. Foolishly but beautifully. I have no regrets, no one should. This hurts so bad but I'd do it again and again if it meant to have you in my life for a brief period of time. Thank you for eberything, Kanak. This may not be what you wanted but this is what it is. Punish me or forgive me, it's on you and no pressure. And mai english nervous hone pr use krta ya fir tab jab meko koi baat kehni serious si vo less chomu lgti dusro ko lol. hehe.
